1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 3 minutes
	If the main database instance is down from an infrastructure defect, Amazon RDS automatically switches to the standby read-replica in another Availability Zone as Multi-AZ turned-on.
	Failover period is typically 60-120 seconds as AWS document. There are some situations which can increase failover time such as large transactions.
	So it should be safe if we set minimum RTO for single AZ outage is around 3 minutes
	
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 1 hour
	If the whole active region is down, a technical staff need to promote the read-replica in the secondary region to be a writable instance
	and change application configuration to the promoted instance for DB write operations. Assume that it happends at midnight, it may takes
	15 minutes for a staff received an alert, get up and login into system (AWS Console or monitoring system).
	Assume that it takes another 15 minutes for the staff to investigate the root cause of the issue. After the root cause discovered, it may
	take up to 20 minutes for him to fix the issue. Total of assumption period is around 50 minutes. With some buffer, 1 hour for this kind of incident should be good enough.
	
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: 0 minutes
	
	With Multi-AZ DB instance configuration, there is a read-replica for primary database in another Availability Zone.
	Data is synchronously copy to that DB instance. So in case of primary instance failed, it should have no data loss.
	
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 0 minutes

	As there is a read-replica in another region and data is synchronously copy to that DB instance.
	So in case of whole region failed, it should have no data loss.
