Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: a few minutes (usually 1–2 minutes)

	If Multi-AZ configuration is setup, RDS will automatically fails over to a standby instance in another AZ without any manual intervention. This process usually take 1–2 minutes to complete.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage: can be 1 hour

	00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes) 
	00:05 - An amount of time passes before an triggers (5 minutes)
	00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
	00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
	00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
	00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
	00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
	00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)
	
	So - roughly need 1 hour

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: should be zero

	If Multi-AZ configuration is setup, data is synchronously copy to a standby database instance in another Availability Zone.
	Therefore in case of primary instance failed, it should have no data loss and RPO should be zero.
	
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage (depends on how often data is backed up - can be 1 hour, etc)

	If automated backups enabled for RDS database, the RPO depends on how often data is backed up. Assume that data be backed up every hour, the minimum RPO will be 1 hour.
