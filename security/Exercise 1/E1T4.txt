Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The InstanceRole role (which be associated with RecipeWebServiceInstance and AttackInstance through InstanceProfileRole) has the policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" (defined in c3-app.yml) violates least privilege principal.
As defined in c3-app.yml, it allow access to all S3 buckets. It should allow access to only resources under S3 bucket: cand-c3-free-recipes-***, and should restrict actions upon those resources (just allow read and list action).

# Poor practice 2
The WebAppSG security group inbound rules are not restricted enough. It allow ingress traffic from all IPs.
It should allow requests coming from the ALB only or at least only allow those IPs from in the same trusted public internet with WebServiceInstance (10.192.10.0/24)

# Poor practice 3
The WebServiceInstance EC2 instance does not reside in a private subnet.
As this server is placed behind an Application Load Balancer which be accessible from internet so the application should work if we put WebServiceInstance in a private subnet.

# Poor practice 4
There is no server side encryption for those S3 buckets: S3BucketRecipesFree (not too important as recipes are free), S3BucketRecipesSecret (important as recipes are proprietary)
