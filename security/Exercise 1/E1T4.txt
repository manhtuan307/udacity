Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The InstanceRole role (which be associated with RecipeWebServiceInstance and AttackInstance through InstanceProfileRole) has the policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" (defined in c3-app.yml) violates least privilege principal.
As defined in c3-app.yml, it allow access to all S3 buckets. It should allow access to only resources under S3 bucket: cand-c3-free-recipes-***, and should restrict actions upon those resources.

# Poor practice 2
The WebAppSG security group inbound rules are not restricted enough. It allow ingress traffic from all IPs.
It should allow requests coming from the ALB only or at least only allow those internal IPs from in the same trusted public internet.

# Poor practice 3
The RecipeWebServiceInstance EC2 instance does not reside in a private subnet even though the server is places behind an ALB

# Poor practice 4
There is no server side encryption for those S3 buckets: S3BucketRecipesFree, S3BucketRecipesSecret
