# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

We can do the following to reduce internet facing attack surface:
- Move Web Service Instance to the private subnet as ALB in public subnet is enough for internet access
- Redirect http to https in Application Load Balancer
- Setup WAF for Application Load Balancer

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Creating VPC private endpoints for S3 will not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
If the attacker can access the attack instance, he/she still be able to access S3 buckets.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, default encryption setting apply to new objects only.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All manual changes made by console or CLI will be reset if cloud formation templates applied.
